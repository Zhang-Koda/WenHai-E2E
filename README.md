We thank the ECMWF for providing ERA5 reanalysis (https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.adbb2d47) and IFS HRES forecasts (https://doi.org/10.21957/open-data). We thank the Institute of Atmospheric Physics for providing CODC-v2 Global Ocean Temperature and Salinity Profile Database (http://www.ocean.iap.ac.cn/ftp/cheng/CODCv2_Insitu_T_S_database/). The Argo dataset was collected and provided openly by the International Argo Program and its contributing national partner programs (https://argo.ucsd.edu, https://www.ocean-ops.org). The altimeter products were produced by Ssalto/Duacs and distributed by AVISO+, with support from CNES (https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr). The surface drifter data are produced by the Global Drifter Program (https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/gdp/data.php).
